# Sample code for processing the data

**Required data per watershed:**

1\. Annual total precipitation

2\. Annual total discharge (normalized using watershed's area)

3\. Annual water balance ET (computed as P-Q per year)

## Libraries
```{r}

library(tidyverse)     # collection of R packages designed for data science
library(here)          # for file paths relative to the project root

```

## Data 1: watershed's annual water balance ET

### a. Computation for the "abnormal" water balance ET

```{r}



```


## Data 2: 190 sites

```{r}

data_sites <- read.csv(here("Data", "data_sites.csv"))

```
