# Sample code for processing the data

**Required data per watershed:**

1\. Annual total precipitation

2\. Annual total discharge (normalized using watershed's area)

3\. Annual water balance ET (computed as P-Q per year)

## Libraries
```{r}

library(tidyverse)

```

## Data 1: watershed's annual P, Q, and ET (sample_data_1)

### a. Computation for the "abnormal" water balance ET

```{r}



```


## Data 2: 190 sites

```{r}


```
